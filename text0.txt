whatever i just understand that

after [ git clone https://github.com/A-gain/HTML_notes.git ] or something like that

git push pushes the commited changes to git hub
you should [ git add filename, git commit -m "message" ] before say git push

git pull pulls the commited changes from git hub to local storage
`important point you have to set the terminal path to the folder where your modified files gonna store.`
